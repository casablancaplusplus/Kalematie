edit the blueprint -> the authors iformation to contain a role

you where trying to figure out the Bearer stuff and a scheme for the db and the permissions 



user regeistration :
-----------------------------
user registration is done via _addAuthor_() so the call to it should be when the token type is Bearer.


one more thing : when the token type is Bearer, the client should not be able to call 
/api/token
/api/invalidate_token
